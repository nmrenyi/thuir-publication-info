# THUIR Publication Collection Info
## Overview
These days we've been working on constructing a website for THUIR. Here's the [demo](https://thuir.github.io/lab-website-template/) of the website.

Now we're working on the publication collection, which needs everyone to submit their publication list in a pre-defined manner, if any. A demo for publication page is available [here](https://thuir.github.io/lab-website-template/publications/).

The image above shows the basic layout of the publication page. Publications are categorizd by year, descendingly. Each publication is represented by a block, which contains the following components:
1. Title
2. Author List
3. Conference/Journal
4. Publication Date
5. Tags
6. Other Links (like GitHub link to your paper code, website for your paper, etc.)
7. Picture of your paper (a model screenshot or any picture you like)

Although seven parts are displayed in this block, we do not need to fill them all. Actually, the minimal requirement for each paper is only the DOI of the paper. Steps to submit publication info is illustrated in the following section.
